# Hi there, My name is Justin Siegfried 👋

## About Me

- 🏠 My home town is Columbia, SC
- ❤️ I am passionate about backend develop and technology associated with it.
- 🔭 I graduated from University of South Carolina in May 2025 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m always learning something new, right now I'm currently learning Golang on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/solidaccess34) and on some personal projects that I will add to my github profile as I am working on them.
